# Tutorial on Dynamic IoT Data, Protocol, and Middleware Interoperability with Resource Slice Concepts and Tools

This git contains material for the tutorial on dynamic IoT interoperability to be held in the [ACM IoT 2018 Conference](http://iot-conference.org/) by [Hong-Linh Truong](http://rdsea.github.io).

The tutorial will examine cross-layered, cross-system interoperability issues and present a DevOps IoT Interoperability approach for defining
metadata, selecting resources and software artifacts, and
provisioning and connecting resources to create various
potential solutions for IoT Cloud interoperability using
resource slice concepts. Second, the tutorial will present
techniques for dynamically provisioning data pipelines,
middleware services, protocol adapters and custom
solutions to address cross-layered, cross-system
interoperability for IoT Cloud applications. Such solutions
also allow dynamic reconfiguration of resources to
add/remove interoperability support. We will present the
concepts and techniques with hands-on examples using our
research tools [rsiHub](https://github.com/sincconcept/HINC) and [IoTCloudSamples](https://github.com/rdsea/IoTCloudSamples).

The material will be continuously updated.
